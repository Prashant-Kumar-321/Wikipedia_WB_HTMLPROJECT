            loans and demand policy reforms from recipients.

            <p>In its early years, the Bank made a slow start for two resons: it was underfunded,and there were
              leadership struggles between the US Executive Director and the President of the organization.
              When the <a href="#" title="Marshall Plan">Marshal Plan </a> went into effect in 1947, many European

              infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and powe plants, that would generate enough
              income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the <a href="#">International Development
                Association</a> was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing
              countries .

            <p>
              Before 1974, the reconstruction and development loans the World Bank made were relatively small. Its staff

            <p>
              The first country ot receive a World Bank loan was France in 1947. The Bank's president at the time ,<a

              The loan was for US$250 million, half the amount requested, and came wih strict Conditions. France had to
              agree to produce a balanced budget and given priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other
              government.World Bank staff Closely monitored the use of the funds to ensur that French government met the

              Beginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental

              especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm
              the environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable diseases such as
              malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world, and joining combat forces. In 2000 the bank
              announced a <em style="font-style:normal;">"war on AIDS"</em> and in 2011 the bank joined the Stop
              Tuberculosis Partnership.

              Traditionally, based on a tacit understanding between the United States and Europe, the <a href="#"
                title="president of the World Bank">president of the World Bank</a> has been selected from candidates
              nominated by the United States. This is significant because the World Bank tends to lend more readily to
              countries that are friendly with the United States, not because of direct U.S. influence but because of
              the employees of the World Bank. In 2012, for the first time, two non-US citizens were nominated.
            </p>

              On 23 March 2012, U.S. President <a href="#" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> announced that the
              United States would nominate <a href="#" title="Jim Yong Kim">Jim Yong Kim</a> as the next president of

            Various developments brought the <a href="#" title="Millennium Development Goals">Millennium Development

            integration of the development and environment agendas, more as well as better aid, movement on trade

          </p>
          <!-- Definition List (Criteria)  -->
          <dl>

            <dt> <strong>Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger:</strong> </dt>
            <dd> From 1990 through 2004, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to
              less than a fifth. Although results vary widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the
              world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty. Africa's
              poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the 36 countries where 90% of the world's
              undernourished children live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving
              the goal of halving under-nutrition.</dd>


            <dt><strong>Achieve Universal Primary Education:</strong> </dt>

            <dd>The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005.
              Still, about 72 million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated as of
              2005.</dd>
            </dt>

            <dt><strong>Promote Gender Equality:</strong> </dt>

            <dd>The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men—worldwide more
              than 60%—are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created
              to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.</dd>


            <dt><strong>Reduce Child Mortality:</strong> </dt>
            <dd>There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently
              in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most
              of their deaths were from preventable causes.</dd>


            <dt><strong>Improve Maternal Health:</strong> </dt>
            <dd>Almost all of the half-million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in
              Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health
              care interventions to be made widely accessible.</dd>


            <dt><strong>Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases:</strong> </dt>
            <dd>Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with
              HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent.
              Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across
              countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6 million deaths in 2007).
              There are 300 to 500 million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1 million deaths. Nearly all
              the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.</dd>


            <dt><strong>Ensure Environmental Sustainability:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which
              continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.
            </dd>


            <dt><strong>Develop a Global Partnership for Development: </strong></dt>

            <dd>Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current
              rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with
              multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.</dd>

          <div id="Environmental_and_social_Safegurards">
            <h2>Environmental and Social Safeguards</h2>

            <p>To ensure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their
              realisation, the following environmental, social, and legal safeguards were defined: Environmental
              Assessment, Indigenous Peoples, Involuntary Resettlement, Physical Cultural Resources, Forests, Natural
              Habitats, Pest Management, Safety of Dams, Projects in Disputed Areas, Projects on International
              Waterways, and Performance Standards for Private Sector Activities.</p>

            <p>At the World Bank's 2012 annual meeting in Tokyo, a review of these safeguards was initiated, which was
              welcomed by several civil society organisations. As a result, the World Bank developed a new Environmental
              and Social Framework, which has been in implementation since 1 October 2018.</p>

          <p>The President of the Bank is the president of the entire <a href="#" title="World Bank Group">World Bank
              Group</a>. The president is responsible for chairing meetings of the boards of directors and for overall
            management of the Bank. Traditionally, the president of the Bank has always been a U.S. citizen nominated by
            the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank (the managing director of the <a href="#"
              title="IMF">International Monetary Fund</a> having always been a European). The nominee is subject to
            confirmation by the board of executive directors to serve a five-year, renewable term. While most World Bank
            presidents have had banking experience, some have not.</p>

          <p>
            The vice presidents of the Bank are its principal managers, in charge of regions, sectors, networks and
            functions. There are two executive vice presidents, three senior vice presidents, and 24 vice presidents.
          </p>

          <P>
            The boards of directors consist of the World Bank Group president and 25 executive directors. The president
            is the presiding officer, and ordinarily has no vote except to break a tie. The executive directors as
            individuals cannot exercise any power or commit or represent the Bank unless the boards specifically
            authorized them to do so. With the term beginning 1 November 2010, the number of executive directors
            increased by one, to 25.
